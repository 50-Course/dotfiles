## > `$HOME` sweet `$HOME`

</div>

I have moved away from GUI-based development workflow to terminal-based workflow over the past year. This repository contains my personal configuration
files for my development environments. This is a 'living' repository that would continue growing for as long as I seek ways for efficiency in my dev workflow.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `$HOME` directory.
2. Run `./install.sh` to symlink all the configuration files to `$HOME` using ![GNU Stow][1]
3. _I am actively working on provide a comprehensive user guide, please stick with me_
